      <h2>Collaborations""</h2>
      <p>
        During the time period of Beethoven's life, collaborations with other
        artists were not commonly practiced. Beethoven did have a couple of
        "colaborations" with other artists though. They were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A publisher by the name of Anton Diabelli invited a large number of
          Austrian composers to write variations to the <em>Walz</em>. Beethoven
          not only accepted (along with 51 other composers), but he wrote 33
          variations that were published as his
          <em>Diabelli Variations, Op 120</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
          The second considered "collaboration" would be considered more of a
          transformation by antoher artist. In this specific case, Franz Liszt
          and others have taken Beethoven's work and arranged them to use other
          combinations of instruments.
        </li>
      </ul>
