        <h2>Collaborations</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            During the time period of Beethoven's life, collaborations with
            other artists were not commonly practiced. Beethoven did have a
            couple of "collaborations" with other artists though. They were:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A publisher by the name of Anton Diabelli invited a large number
              of Austrian composers to write variations to the <em>Walz</em>.
              Beethoven not only accepted (along with 51 other composers), but
              he wrote 33 variations that were published as his
              <em>Diabelli Variations, Op 120</em>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second considered "collaboration" would be considered more of
              a transformation by antoher artist. In this specific case, Franz
              Liszt, as well as many others, have taken Beethoven's work and
              arranged them to use other combinations of instruments.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
      <!-- inlcuded his only known alias -->
      <section>
        <h2>Aliases</h2>
        <p>
          Beethoven's only known alias is <strong>"Maestro"</strong>, but is
          assumed to have others.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <!-- His current residence is his gravesite. Plan to incorporate a picture with this as well.  Make it smaller than the original pic   -->
        <h2>Country of Residence</h2>
        <div class="residence">
          <p>
            Beethoven's remains currently reside in the Main Cemetary in
            Zentralfriedhof, Vienna Austria and has been there since 1888. He
            was originally buried at WÃ¤hringer Ortsfriedhof just outside of
            Vienna, Austria, but was moved due to the cemetary shutting down in
            1873.
