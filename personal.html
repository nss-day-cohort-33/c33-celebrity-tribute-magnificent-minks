        <h3 id="julie">Julie ("Giulietta") Guicciardi</h3>
        <h5>(1782-1822)</h5>
        <p>
          Beethoven met Giuliette in 1801. They met through the Brunsvik family.
          Beethoven was very close with her cousins. Beethoven fell for
          Giuliette when while he was her piano teacher. <br />
          In 1802, he deidcated <em>Moonlight Sonata</em> to her. Beethoven even
          admitted that he was in love with her at the time, but due to clashing
          class position, they never married.

        <h3 id="karl">Karl van Beethoven</h3>
        <h5>(1806-1858)</h5>
        <p>
          Ludwig had a strong father-role in Karl's life. He believed that
          Karl's mother, Ludwig's sister, Johanna was not suited to raise Karl.
          The two entered into an intense custody battle over Karl. Ludwig even
          took a break from music because he became consumed in the court.
          Ludwig would eventually win custody, but would also come to be
          resented by Karl. Ludwig did what he thought was best for the young
          boy. One of his decisions was to not let the boy see his mother. Karl
          ran away from boarding school to see Johanna and Ludwig was furious.
          He switched him between boarding school's. Ludwig did what he did
          everytime he has to destress which was to consume himself in his
          music. The music he wrote/composed is very difficult to play and
          experts say you can hear his pain. All in all, Ludwig and Karl's
          relationship was emotionally draining and conflicting for the both of
          them.

        <h3 id="therese">Therese Malfatti</h3>
        <h5>(1792-1851)</h5>
        <p>
          Beethoven was infatuated with Therese Malfatti for a period of time.
          It is not certain that he ever proposed, but historians have a strong
          belief that he did. In some of her letters from Beethoven, "Fur Elise"
          was found among some of Therese's personal papers. The song was
          written for her.
